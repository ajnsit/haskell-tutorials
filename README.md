# Haskell Tutorials

## Lens is the new Monad

1. [Lenses from scratch](lenses-from-scratch.md)

  This tutorial is distilled from [Edward's talk on Lenses](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cefnmjtAolY). I found it incredibly dense so started taking notes. Soon the notes gave way to a markdown file for more permanent storage.
  
  ***Note: This is WIP***

## TODO

These are tutorials planned for a later date -

1. Wai-routes
2. REST API Generation
3. Free Monads
4. Reactive Programming
